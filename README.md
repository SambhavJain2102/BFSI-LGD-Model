# BFSI LGD Prediction  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a simple case study in the **Banking and Financial Services (BFSI)** domain, focusing on predicting **Loss Given Default (LGD)**. LGD is an important measure in credit risk that shows how much a bank loses when a borrower defaults.  

The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, preprocess the dataset, apply a **Linear Regression model**, and evaluate its performance.

## 🎯 Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Cleaned and structured the dataset  
   - Created target variable (LGD = (EAD – Recovery) / EAD)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Checked distributions of key features  
   - Looked at relationships between loan attributes and LGD  
   - Visualized patterns using charts  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Applied **Linear Regression** for LGD prediction  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Used metrics like **R²**, **RMSE**, and **MAE** to evaluate model performance

## ⚙️ Tools Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for Linear Regression and metrics)  

---

## 📊 Results  
- The Linear Regression model gave a baseline understanding of LGD prediction.  
- EDA showed that **collateral value** and **loan type** were significant drivers of LGD.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Add macroeconomic variables for better prediction.  
- Build a dashboard for easier interpretation.
